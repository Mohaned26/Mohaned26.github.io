# My favorite country: Japan 🇯🇵
![Mount Fuji and Cherry Blossoms](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Cherry_Blossoms_and_Mount_Fuji.jpg)

Japan has always fascinated me. To me, it represents a place where **tradition blends beautifully with modern life**. Every time I read about Japan, watch its films, or listen to its music, I feel both inspired and curious. It’s not just a destination on a map—it’s an experience I hope to live fully one day.

## Why Japan Inspires Me
There are a few things about Japan that have always stayed with me:  

- 🌸 *The changing seasons*, especially cherry blossoms that symbolize new beginnings.  
- 🍜 The comforting taste of ramen and sushi—simple yet rich in culture.  
- 🎎 The way traditions like tea ceremonies or festivals connect people across generations.  

Each of these reflects values I admire: mindfulness, beauty in small details, and respect for history.

## My Connection to Modern Japan
What excites me just as much as the traditions is **modern Japan**. I love how the country embraces cutting-edge technology without losing its soul. Watching bullet trains glide past temples feels symbolic: *the future and the past, existing side by side*.  

### Pop Culture I Enjoy
- Anime and manga have been part of my creative life since I was young.  
- I often find myself exploring [Tokyo street fashion](https://www.gotokyo.org/en/) and J-pop online—it feels bold, colorful, and full of energy.

## A Dream Visit
If I could plan a trip, these are the top 3 things I’d love to experience:  
1. 🌸 Walk under the sakura trees in Kyoto.  
2. 🗻 See Mount Fuji at sunrise.  
3. 🍣 Try authentic sushi at a tiny Tokyo restaurant.  

I often browse sites like [Japan Travel](https://www.japan.travel/en/) or watch [NHK World](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/) documentaries just to imagine what it would feel like to actually be there.
